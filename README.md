# hdr_fusion248

Debevec-style HDR reconstruction engine written from scratch in Rust (1.85.1),
using `nalgebra` 0.33.2 for the least-squares/SVD solve and `png` 0.17.16 for image I/O.
No HTTP, no frontend, no registration / de-ghosting / color management.

## Input

A JSON job file lists 3 to 8 aligned, static 8-bit RGB PNGs of identical size
(each side <= 512 px) with finite positive exposure times in seconds, at least
two distinct values:

```json
{
  "frames": [
    { "path": "img_1_250s.png", "exposure_seconds": 0.004 },
    { "path": "img_1_60s.png",  "exposure_seconds": 0.0166667 },
    { "path": "img_1_15s.png",  "exposure_seconds": 0.0666667 },
    { "path": "img_1_4s.png",   "exposure_seconds": 0.25 },
    { "path": "img_1s.png",     "exposure_seconds": 1.0 }
  ],
  "output_pfm": "out.pfm",
  "mask_png": "mask.png",
  "report_json": "report.json"
}
```

Paths are resolved relative to the job file. Output paths are optional and
default to `hdr_fusion_output.pfm`, `hdr_fusion_mask.png` and
`hdr_fusion_report.json` next to the job file. Input images are never modified.

## Algorithm

1. **Sampling.** For each channel, at most 128 points are picked on a uniform
   2-D cell-centered grid covering the image. A point is discarded when its
   value is 0 in every exposure or 255 in every exposure.
2. **Response recovery (Debevec & Malik).** The 256 log inverse-response
   entries `g[z]` and per-sample log radiances `ln E_i` are solved jointly:
   - data rows: `w(z) * (g[z] - ln E_i - ln dt) = 0`,
   - smoothness rows: `10 * w(z) * (g[z-1] - 2 g[z] + g[z+1]) = 0`,
   - anchor row: `g[128] = 0`,
   - with the triangle/hat weight `w(z) = min(z, 255 - z)`.
   The over-determined system is solved by SVD (`nalgebra`). Its numerical
   rank must equal the number of unknowns (rank threshold
   `max(m,n) * eps * sigma_max`); otherwise the material is not identifiable
   and the run fails with a rank error. No fixed gamma or built-in HDR
   function is used.
3. **Fusion.** Per pixel and channel, with the same hat weight,
   `ln E = sum w(z) (g[z] - ln dt) / sum w(z)`, then `E = exp(ln E)`.
   Results are not normalized to any maximum and are not clipped to [0, 1].
   When every exposure at a channel is 0/255 (`w = 0`), the value is written
   as 0 and flagged invalid in the mask. Any non-finite result is an error.

## Outputs

- RGB 32-bit little-endian floating point PFM (bottom-up rows, scale `-1.0`).
- Same-size RGB mask PNG: channel = 255 when valid, 0 when invalid.
- JSON report containing, for each channel: all 256 `g` values, the sample
  coordinates actually used, their fitted log radiances, SVD rank / singular
  values, the achieved weighted data residual RMS and maximum absolute
  residual, the smoothness residual RMS, per-channel radiance statistics,
  plus the exposure sources (paths, exposure seconds, log exposure).

Outputs are staged via temporary files and renamed into place together; a
failed reconstruction never leaves a partial delivery behind.

## Relative scale

The anchor `g[128] = 0` fixes the additive degree of freedom in log space, so
radiance is on a **relative** linear scale: multiplying all true radiances by
a constant `c` corresponds to shifting every exposure time by `1/c` and leaves
the 8-bit input unchanged. Ratios of reconstructed radiance values are
meaningful (and exposure-independent); absolute photometric units (cd/m^2)
are not recoverable without calibration.

## Usage

```sh
cargo build --release

# reconstruct a bracketed exposure set described by job.json
./target/release/hdr_fusion248 run path/to/job.json

# in-memory self-test against a synthetic scene with a known nonlinear
# (tanh-based, non-gamma) response curve
./target/release/hdr_fusion248 selftest

# write the synthetic exposures + job into ./demo and reconstruct them
./target/release/hdr_fusion248 demo [outdir]
```

The demo scene spans a wide log-radiance range and includes a region so
bright it saturates even the longest exposure; those sun channels are
reported invalid in the mask (0) rather than guessed. On the reference
machine the self-test reconstructs non-saturated channels with a log-radiance
RMSE around 0.01 and `|g[128]|` around 5e-12.
